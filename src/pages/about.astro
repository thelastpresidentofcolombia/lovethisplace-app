                LoveThisPlace was born from a simple but powerful observation:
                modern tourism is broken. It's built on an extractive model
                where booking giants take large commissions, pulling revenue out
                of local economies, and anonymous reviews have replaced trusted
                advice. This creates a cycle of resentment where residents feel
                displaced by an industry that doesn't benefit them.
            </p>
            <p>We are changing that.</p>
            <h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold !mt-12">
                A New Way Forward
            </h2>
            <p>
                Our mission is to create a circular travel economy. We are a
                platform built to redirect tourism spending back to the people
                who make a place special: the locals, the passionate experts,
                and the independent business owners.
            </p>
            <p>
                By empowering a network of trusted referrers, we replace
                impersonal algorithms with authentic, community-driven
                discovery. The result is a win-win-win: travelers get trusted
                recommendations at fair prices, locals earn for sharing their
                knowledge, and small businesses thrive.
            </p>
            <p>
                LoveThisPlace is more than a platform; it's a movement to make
                travel a source of pride and prosperity for everyone.
